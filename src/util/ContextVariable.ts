/**
 * A `ContextVariable` maintains a value which depends on the device context (`MR_ActiveDevice`).
 *
 * Why?
 *
 * During the lifetime of a MIDI Remote script, several "script instances" may be created. For
 * instance, when disabling a controller script (via the MIDI Remote Manager) and enabling it again,
 * plain JS variables in the script keep their values while the `MR_ActiveDevice` changes.
 * `ContextVariable`s limit the lifetime of their values to the lifetime of the device context
 * (`MR_ActiveDevice`).
 *
 * Originally, `ContextVariable` was using JSON (de)serialization along with `context.setState()`
 * and `context.getState()` to store the variable values as strings in the context itself. This
 * approach would have allowed for multiple active devices of the same script at the same time –
 * which is not a supported scenario of this script anyway. Hence, the current implementation uses a
 * minimalistic "reset to default when the device context changes" approach – presuming that there
 * is only one active script instance at any time and that there is only one context object during
 * the lifetime of that script instance.
